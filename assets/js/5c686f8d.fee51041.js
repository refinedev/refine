We looked at an example that uses TypeScript `Pick<>` to create a new type by picking a few properties from a type with larger shape. We found out that a type transformation can take both an interface as well as a type as its base, but the generated type cannot be declared as an interface.\n\n`Omit<>`, the opposite equivalent of `Pick<>`, can be used when we have more properties to pick and less to omit. We'll look at it in the next post.\n")))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

WebSockets provides the relevant and most efficient means to achieve real-time communication. In this article, we explored the concept of WebSockets, its benefits, why it is superior to other traditional HTTP methods, and why developers should adopt WebSockets. Finally, we illustrated how to integrate WebSockets into React and Node.js applications."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

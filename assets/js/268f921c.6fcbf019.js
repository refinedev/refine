To avoid scheduling the pods on the same node again, techniques such as reducing the number of replicas before deletion must be adopted."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"It is highly recommended that before adopting pod deletion techniques in a production Kubernetes cluster, you practice and experiment in a safe, non-production environment such as a development or staging cluster.

You can improve your skills, test your understanding of pod behaviors, and fine-tune your deletion procedures by practicing in a controlled environment. Careful preparation in a secure environment is essential for Kubernetes pod management success."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

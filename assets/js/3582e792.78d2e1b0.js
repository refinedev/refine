On the other hand, Node.js has a larger ecosystem, extensive community support, and compatibility with a wide range of programming languages. It relies on the V8 engine and offers a rich set of third-party tools and libraries. Choosing between Bun and Node.js depends on factors such as performance requirements, specific project needs, and the availability of suitable tooling and community support.

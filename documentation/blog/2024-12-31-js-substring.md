## Introduction

This post is about how to effectively use the `String.prototype.substring()` method in JavaScript. We go through a few examples to understand how it works, play around to observe a few patterns and explore the quirks.

### What is JavaScript `substring()`?

JavaScript `substring()` is a `String` method that is typically used to extract and store part of a string. During the extraction, the original string remains intact, and the target part is returned as a new string.

`String.prototype.substring()` is handy for producing substrings of characters from a point to another of a parent string. The substring may be from the beginning, in-between specified indexes or from the tail.

In this post, we perform some exercise with the JS `substring()` method by going through a few examples. We start by getting familiar with the method signature of `String.prototype.substring()`, the required argument (`startIndex`), the additional argument (`endIndex`) and understand which ones to use when. We then go ahead and see examples of extracting a number of characters after a starting index, characters from a range between two indexes, characters from the beginning and from the tail. While doing so, we elaborate on a few patterns of extraction from a parent string: namely, that of extracting a tail after first `n` characters, another of producing a substring composed of first `n` characters and that of extracting last `n` characters.

In the later half of the post, we discuss some of the nuances associated with `startIndex` and `endIndex` values. In the end, we point out how JavaScript `String.prototype.substring()` compares to `String.prototype.slice()` as well as the deprecated method `String.prototype.substr()`.

## JavaScript `substring()` Method

`Array.prototype.substring()` takes two possible arguments: a `startIndex` and an `endIndex`. `startIndex` is mandatory, while `endIndex` can be passed to explicitly indicate the termination of extraction.

### `Array.prototype.substring()` Method Signature

We can call `substring()`with the below possible signatures:

```js
substring(startIndex);
substring(startIndex, endIndex);
```

`startIndex` represents the point where substring extraction kicks off. The value at `startIndex` is **inclusive**, i.e. it is included in the returned substring. The `endIndex` denotes termination of the extraction. However, the value at `endIndex` is **excluded**. This means that we end extraction at the character **_before_** `endIndex`.

Let's see this in action with some examples.

### JavaScript `substring()` with `startIndex` Only

With only `startIndex` passed to `substring()`, we get a substring that begins at `startIndex` and spans to the end of the parent string:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";
console.log(mnemonic.substring(14)); // "cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked."
```

As we can figure out from the string above, chopping starts at `startIndex` and we get the tail from that point on.

### Extract Tail After First `n` Characters - JavaScript `substring()`

Since we are using a zero-based index for `startIndex`, the first `startIndex` number of characters are represented by the index just **before** `startIndex`. And since the value at `startIndex` is included in the extracted tail, the following pattern emerges where with `startIndex = n`, we get the tail **after** first `n` characters in the parent string:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Extract characters after first 14
console.log(mnemonic.substring(14)); // "cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked."

// Extract tail after first 20
console.log(mnemonic.substring(20)); // "monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked."

// Extract tails after 29
console.log(mnemonic.substring(29)); // "and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked."

// Extract after 72
console.log(mnemonic.substring(72)); // "padlocked."
```

### JavaScript `String.prototype.substring()` - Extract a Substring Between Two Points

When we pass both the `startIndex` and `endIndex`, we get a substring of characters in `startIndex <= str < endIndex` range:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";
console.log(mnemonic.substring(14, 27)); // "cats, monkeys"
```

This means, now we end up with a substring that ends **before** the `endIndex`.

### Extract First `n` Characters - JavaScript `substring()`

When we need a substring from the start of the parent string, the `startIndex` should be `0`:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";
console.log(mnemonic.substring(0, 27)); // "Please send, cats, monkeys"
```

With `startIndex = 0` and `endIndex = n`, we get the first `n` characters from the parent string:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// First 12 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(0, 12)); // "Please, send"

// First 18 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(0, 18)); // "Please, send, cats"

// First 27 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(0, 27)); // "Please, send, cats, monkeys"

// First 70 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(0, 70)); // "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure"
```

### Extract Last `n` Characters Using `String.prototype.substring()`

We can get the last `n` characters by leveraging the caller `length` in `startIndex`:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Last 9 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(mnemonic.length - 9)); // "padlocked."

// Last 15 characters
console.log(mnemonic.substring(mnemonic.length - 15)); // "sure, padlocked."
```

The way the above pattern works is that `mnemonic.length` sets the `startIndex` **just outside** the parent string. Moving `startIndex` back by `-n` repositions the extraction entry to the tail by `n`. And since we are not passing `endIndex`, extraction continues till the end of the string. So, we get the last `n` characters.

## Nuances of `startIndex` and `endIndex` in JavaScript `substring()`

Other quirks of using `substring()` include cases when `startIndex` is greater than `endIndex` and when either of `startIndex` and `endIndex` or both are negative. Let's look at them one by one.

### JavaScript `substring()` with `startIndex > endIndex`

When `startIndex` is greater than `endIndex` JavaScript `substring()` **swaps** the indexes to produce the substring:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Swaps to mnemonic.substring(0, 6)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(6, 0)); // "Please"
```

### JavaScripty `substring()` with Negative `startIndex` and `endIndex`

A negative value of `startIndex` or `endIndex` sets the respective value to `0`:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Same as mnemonic.substring(0, 6)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(-1, 6)); // "Please"

// Same as mnemonic.substring(0, 0)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(-1, -6)); // ""

// // Same as mnemonic.substring(12, 0)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(12, -6)); // "Please, send"
```

In the last invocation above, swapping between `startIndex` and `endIndex` is also involved since `12 > 0`. The call is equivalent to `mnemonic.substring(0, 12);`.

## `String.prototype.substring()` Comparison

In this section, we briefly discuss how JavaScript `substring()` method differs from `slice()` and `substr()`, which are also similar `String`extraction methods.

### JavaScript `substring()` vs `slice()`

`String.prototype.substring()` and `String.prototype.slice()` both implement string extraction almost identically. However, there are some subtle differences in their implementations.

For example, swapping of arguments -- which we saw above in `substring()` -- doesn't take place in `slice()` when `startIndex > endIndex`:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Swaps to mnemonic.substring(0, 6)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(6, 0)); // "Please"

// Doesn't swap. Returns empty string, meaning non-existent characters
console.log(mnemonic.slice(6, 0)); // ""
```

With `slice()`, `startIndex > endIndex` returns an empty string.

Another difference is when either or both of `startIndex` and `endIndex` are negative. In general, when they are negative, `slice()` wraps `startIndex` and `endIndex` to the tail by traversing backward from the last character. And then if `startIndex < endIndex`, slicing works:

```js
const mnemonic = "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

// Zeroes and swaps to mnemonic.substring(0, 18)
console.log(mnemonic.substring(18, -12)); // "Please, send, cats"

// Doesn't swap, -12 finds index from tail. String is long enough, slicing works
console.log(mnemonic.slice(20, -12)); // "monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure"
.........

console.log(mnemonic.substring(-12, 18)); // "Please, send, cats"

// Doesn't swap. -12 finds index from tail, but startIndex > endIndex. Returns non-existent string
console.log(mnemonic.slice(-12, 18)); // ""
.........

console.log(mnemonic.substring(-16, -12)); // ""

// Both startIndex and endIndex finds index from tail. startIndex < endIndex. Slicing works
console.log(mnemonic.slice(-16, -12)); // "sure"
```

### JavaScript `substring()` vs `substr()`

JavaScript `substr()` is also another method for extracting substrings from a parent string. However, it is a legacy `String` method that accepts the `length` of the target substring, instead of an index for extraction exit.

In other words, with `substr()`, we get indicate the `length` of the substring:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

console.log(mnemonic.substring(10, 12)); // "nd"

// Gets 12 characters starting from startIndex onwards
console.log(mnemonic.substr(10, 12)); // "nd, cats, mo"
```

Also, as with `slice()`, with a negative `startIndex`, `substr()` counts backwards from the last character:

```js
const mnemonic =
  "Please, send, cats, monkeys, and, zebras, in, large, cages, make, sure, padlocked.";

console.log(mnemonic.substring(-10, 12)); // "Please, send"

// startIndex wraps to 10 items from tail. Gets 10 characters from tail, doesn't have the other 2
console.log(mnemonic.substr(-10, 12)); // "padlocked."
```

In this case, only `10` characters are picked because `2` out of targeted `12` are not available in the last `10` characters.

## Common Mistakes When Working With substring()

Over the years, I have encountered a few mistakes developers make using the substring() method. Let me outline them below.

### Skipping endIndex

A lot of us forget that the endIndex is optional. If you donâ€™t pass it, substring() just extracts everything from the startIndex to the end of the string. Thatâ€™s OK most of the time, but if you accidentally leave it out when you meant to extract a certain range, it may mess things up.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text.substring(7)); // "World!"
console.log(text.substring(7, 12)); // "World"
```

Before using substring(), I double-check whether I really need the endIndex or not.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text.substring(-5)); // "Hello, World!" (negative becomes 0)
console.log(text.slice(-5)); // "orld!"
```

What I do now: In cases when I need negative indexing, I stick with slice().

### Reversed Indices Confusion

If the value of startIndex is greater than the value of endIndex, substring() will swap them. If youâ€™re not paying attention, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text.substring(12, 7)); // "World" (indices are swapped)
console.log(text.slice(12, 7)); // "" (slice doesn't swap, just returns an empty string)
```

What I do now: Always ensure that startIndex <= endIndex whenever using substring().

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if startIndex equals endIndex?**

You will get an empty string because substring() does not include the endIndex.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text.substring(5, 5)); // ""
```

**Can substring() change the original string?**

Nope - itâ€™s non-destructive, simply returning the new string and leaving the original alone.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
const result = text.substring(7);
console.log(result); // "World!"
console.log(text); // "Hello, World!"
```

**What if the indices are out of range?**

If the indices exceed the length of the string, substring() will simply stop at the stringâ€™s end.

```tsx
const text = "Hello";
console.log(text.substring(2, 10)); // "llo"
console.log(text.substring(10, 20)); // ""
```

**How does substring() differ from slice()?**

Both do similar things, but hereâ€™s the difference:

- substring() swaps indices if startIndex > endIndex. slice() doesnâ€™t.
- slice() supports negative indices; substring() doesnâ€™t.

```tsx
const text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text.substring(7, 12)); // "World"
console.log(text.slice(-5)); // "orld!"
```

**Negative Indices Misconception**

Hereâ€™s a big one: substring() doesnâ€™t handle negative numbers. If you pass in a negative startIndex or endIndex, it will just treat them as 0. Iâ€™ve seen people confuse this with slice(), which actually supports negative indices.

## Summary

In this post, we exercised the use of JavaScript `substring()` with some basic examples. We first learned that `substring()` is a `String` extraction method that returns a target portion from a parent string. We got familiar with the required `startIndex` argument whose value is included in the extracted substring, and also with the `endIndex` argument which indicates termination of the string.

We then explored with examples how to use `substring()` with only `startIndex` and discovered how to extract the tail after first `n` characters of the parent string. We also saw how to extract a substring between two points with `startIndex` and `endIndex` passed. We found out another pattern where we can produce the first `n` characters by passing `0` as `startIndex` and `n` as the `endIndex`. We also figured out how we can extract the last `n` characters using caller `length - n`.

Towards the later half, we touch based on some other nuances of using `startIndex` and `endIndex` values. In the end, we compared and discussed how `substring()` differs in implementation from JavaScript `slice()` and `substr()`.

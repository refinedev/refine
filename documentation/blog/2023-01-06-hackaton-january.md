**[Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)** is a React-based framework for the rapid âœ¨ development of CRUD web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by CRUD operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts like authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n. Refine shines on data-intensive applications like admin panels, dashboards, internal tools and storefronts.

We're proud to have reached thousands of developers who used **[Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)** in our first year, and we couldn't have done it without an open source community!
To celebrate this achievement with the community, we are excited to announce the launch of the first hackathon event.

This hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to showcase their skills and learn **Refine**!

You can win **$1500** and a special gifts along with **limited edition** swag kits!

We can't wait to see what amazing projects the participants will build projects using **Refine**.

## Together with Open Source Community

Refine draws its strength from the open-source community, and we are grateful to have the support of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/), and [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) which has significant contributions to the open source community.

It's worth noting that Refine has built-in data provider support for Strapi, Appwrite, and Medusa. So we believe they will be excellent backend solutions for your hackathon project.

Strapi, Appwrite, Medusa, and Meilisearch will also be providing swag kits for the winners.

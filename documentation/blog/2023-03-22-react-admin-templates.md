## Introduction

Templates are blueprints or models or guides used to make something. We can have a house template, that is used as a sample to build a house. Also in the world of software development, we have website design templates that present ideas on how to create a specific website for specific industries.

Admin templates are prebuilt templates that offer a rich set of features that can be used to quickly build an admin app. The admin app can be a dashboard for your products and services, an app interface, or an admin area.

As React continues to gain popularity in web development, it is becoming increasingly important to have a robust and user-friendly react admin interface. Here are the top five React admin templates that are currently available on the market

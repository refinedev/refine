When it comes to creating internal tools, low-code platforms are the way to go. With Refine CORE, a React-based low-code platform, you can quickly build data-intensive applications without having to worry about scalability or ease of use. Other low-code platforms may allow you to develop your applications, but they are often limited in terms of flexibility and customizability. With Refine CORE, you have full control over your application and can add any business logic that you need. So if you're looking for a platform that will let you build internal tools quickly and easily, Refine CORE is the right choice!

## What is Refine CORE?

Refine CORE is a React-based framework for building data-intensive applications. It's headless by default, giving you complete freedom to use any UI library—whether it's [Ant Design](https://ant.design), Material-UI, Mantine, Chakra UI, or even [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). You can also bring your own custom design system.

Refer to [Refine](https://refine.dev/core) for more information.

## Why you should use Refine CORE?

- **Open Source** under the MIT license
- **Easy to learn** with extensive documentation and examples
- **Headless architecture** - works with any UI library or your own design system
- **Backend agnostic** - connects to any REST or GraphQL API
- **Built on [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) v5** for efficient data management
- **SSR compatible** with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and Remix
- **Supports React 18 and 19**

## Core Features

- **Data fetching and state management** powered by TanStack Query
- **Routing** with React Router, Next.js, or Remix
- **Authentication** and **Authorization**
- **Internationalization (i18n)**
- **Real-time** subscriptions
- **Advanced mutation modes**: optimistic, pessimistic, and undoable

## How does Refine CORE work?

Refine CORE uses a provider-based architecture. Wrap your application with the `<Refine>` component and pass in providers like `dataProvider` (for API communication) and `authProvider` (for authentication). Refine CORE then gives you powerful hooks throughout your app, all powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) v5.

Let's explore the key concepts:

## Communicate with the API

The `dataProvider` handles all API communication—both data fetching and mutations. It implements these methods:

```tsx
const dataProvider = {
  create: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  createMany: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteOne: ({ resource, id, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteMany: ({ resource, ids, meta }) => Promise,
  getList: ({ resource, pagination, sorters, filters, meta }) => Promise,
  getMany: ({ resource, ids, meta }) => Promise,
  getOne: ({ resource, id, meta }) => Promise,
  update: ({ resource, id, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  updateMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, meta }) => Promise,
};
```

Refine CORE's hooks automatically call the appropriate data provider methods. For instance, `useTable` calls `getList` under the hood. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { useTable } from "@refinedev/antd";
import { Table } from "antd";

interface IPost {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  status: "published" | "draft" | "rejected";
}

export const PostList: React.FC = () => {
  const { tableProps, query, result } = useTable<IPost>({
    resource: "posts",
    sorters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: "title",
          order: "asc",
        },
      ],
    },
    filters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: "status",
          operator: "eq",
          value: "draft",
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  // Access TanStack Query state from query object
  const { isLoading, isError } = query;

  // Access the data directly from result
  const posts = result.data;
  const total = result.total;

  return (
    <Table {...tableProps} rowKey="id">
      <Table.Column dataIndex="id" title="ID" />
      <Table.Column dataIndex="title" title="Title" />
      <Table.Column dataIndex="content" title="Content" />
    </Table>
  );
};
```

Behind the scenes, `useTable` calls `getList` with these parameters:

```ts
getList({
  resource: "posts",
  pagination: {
    currentPage: 1,
    pageSize: 10,
  },
  sorters: [
    {
      field: "title",
      order: "asc",
    },
  ],
  filters: [
    {
      field: "status",
      operator: "eq",
      value: "draft",
    },
  ],
});
```

With `meta` you can pass any parameters that you need to the data provider. You can handle it in the data provider.

All hooks that use data provider methods such as `useTable` work with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) v5. In Refine CORE v5, query state is now grouped under a `query` object for better organization:

```tsx
const { query, result } = useTable();

// Access TanStack Query state
const { isLoading, isError, refetch } = query;

// Access data and total
const posts = result.data;
const total = result.total;
```

Refer to the [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/data-provider) for more information.

### Out-of-the-box data providers

Refine CORE includes many out-of-the-box data providers to use in your projects like:

- [Simple REST API](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/simple-rest)
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/graphql)
- [NestJS CRUD](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/nestjsx-crud)
- [Airtable](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/airtable)
- [Strapi v4](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/strapi-v4)
- [Supabase](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/supabase)
- [Hasura](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/hasura)
- [Medusa](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/medusa)
- [Appwrite](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/appwrite)

## Add routing to the application

Refine CORE integrates with your router library of choice through router bindings:

For your Next.js project, use `@refinedev/nextjs-router`. For React projects, use `@refinedev/react-router` (supporting both v6 and v7) or `@refinedev/remix-router` for Remix applications.

Refer to the [routing documentation](https://refine.dev/core/docs/routing/integrations/react-router/) for more information.

### Out-of-the-box router providers

Refine CORE includes many out-of-the-box router integrations to use in your projects like:

- [React Router (v6 & v7)](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/react-router)
- [Next.js Router](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/nextjs-router)
- [Remix Router](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/remix-router)

## Create pages via `resources`

The main building blocks of a Refine app are `resources`. A resource is an entity in the API's endpoint (e.g., https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev/posts). It connects data from the API with page components, allowing pages to access data from the API.

```tsx
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import dataProvider from "@refinedev/simple-rest";
import routerProvider from "@refinedev/react-router";

import { PostList, PostCreate, PostEdit, PostShow } from "pages/posts";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Refine
      dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
      routerProvider={routerProvider}
      resources={[
        {
          name: "posts",
          list: "/posts",
          create: "/posts/create",
          edit: "/posts/edit/:id",
          show: "/posts/show/:id",
        },
      ]}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

In Refine CORE v5, resources now define routes as strings rather than components. The actual route configuration is handled by your router (React Router, Next.js, or Remix). Each resource property corresponds to a route:

- The `/posts` route displays the list page
- The `/posts/create` route displays the create page
- The `/posts/edit/:id` route displays the edit page
- The `/posts/show/:id` route displays the show page

Refine CORE hooks used in these pages read values from the route by default. For example, the `useForm` hook takes the `resource`, `action`, and `id` from the route automatically.

## Authentication

The `authProvider` allows you to add authentication to your application. You can use any authentication library that you want. All your authentication logic is managed with this `authProvider`.

An auth provider must have the following methods:

```tsx
const authProvider = {
  // Required methods
  login: () => Promise,
  logout: () => Promise,
  check: () => Promise,
  onError: () => Promise,
  // Optional methods
  getPermissions: () => Promise,
  getIdentity: () => Promise,
  register: () => Promise,
  forgotPassword: () => Promise,
  updatePassword: () => Promise,
};
```

[Authentication hooks](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authentication/hooks/use-login/) use these methods to handle login, logout, and credential checks. For example, `check` is called when accessing protected pages. See the [`authProvider` docs](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider) for more details.

- OTP Login - [Source Code](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/auth-otp) - [Demo](https://refine.dev/docs/examples/auth-provider/otpLogin/)

## Authorization

Refine CORE provides `accessControlProvider` that you can use to control who has access to what in your app. You can use any access control library that you want. In addition, you can choose the access control models that work best for you (RBAC, ABAC, ACL, etc.).

An `accessControlProvider` must have one async method called `can` to check if the person asking for access is allowed to have it.

```tsx
type CanParams = {
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  params?: any;
};

type CanReturnType = {
  can: boolean;
  reason?: string;
};

const accessControlProvider = {
  can: ({ resource, action, params }: CanParams) => Promise<CanReturnType>,
};
```

[`useCan`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authorization/hooks/use-can) and [`<CanAccess>`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authorization/components/can-access/) component use this method to check if the user is allowed to access.

For example, we can stop non-admin users from editing the post resource.

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => {
  <Refine
    accessControlProvider={{
      can: async ({ resource, action, params }) => {
        if (resource === "posts" && action === "edit") {
          const userRole = getUserRole();

          if (userRole === "admin") {
            return { can: true };
          }

          return Promise.resolve({
            can: false,
            reason: "Unauthorized",
          });
        }

        return Promise.resolve({ can: true });
      },
    }}
  />;
};
```

Refer to the [`accessControlProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authorization/access-control-provider) for more information.

- Permify - [Source Code](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/access-control-permify)

## Internationalization

The `i18nProvider` is used to give localization features to your application. This will allow you to change the text in your application to different languages.

An i18n provider must have the following properties:

```ts
const i18nProvider = {
  translate: (key: string, options?: any, defaultMessage?: string) => string,
  changeLocale: (lang: string, options?: any) => Promise<any>,
  getLocale: () => string,
};
```

Refine CORE uses these methods via [translation hooks](https://refine.dev/core/docs/i18n/i18n-provider/).

Refer to [Refine CORE i18nProvider](https://refine.dev/core/docs/i18n/i18n-provider) for more details and how to use the [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com) package.

## Real-time support

The `liveProvider` is used to add real-time support to your application. You can use any real-time library or tool that you want.

A live provider must have the following properties:

```tsx
const liveProvider = {
  subscribe: ({ channel, params: { ids }, types, callback }) => any,
  unsubscribe: (subscription) => void,
  publish?: (event) => void,
};
```

Refine CORE data hooks are subscribed to using the subscribe method given with the live provider. The subscribe method returns a subscription object that can be used to unsubscribe. The unsubscribe method is used to unsubscribe from the subscription. The publish method is used to publish an event to the channel on the client side.

If you send an event after the relevant operations on the server, Refine CORE will invalidate the related queries. If the `liveMode` is `manual`, queries of related resources are not invalidated in real-time; instead `onLiveEvent` is run with the event as new events from the subscription arrive.

- Appwrite - [Source Code](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/appwrite/src/index.ts#L252)

## Additional Features

### `notificationProvider`

Display notifications during mutations using any notification library.

### `mutationMode`

Control mutation behavior:

- **Pessimistic**: Wait for server confirmation
- **Optimistic**: Update UI immediately
- **Undoable**: Update UI with undo option

### `syncWithLocation`

If `syncWithLocation` is turned on, the list of query parameters may be modified manually by editing directly in the URL.

```
/posts?current=1&pageSize=8&sorters[0][field]=createdAt&sorters[0][order]=desc
```

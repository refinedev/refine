We are very excited to announce that Refine has raised $1M in our first round led by [500 Istanbul](https://istanbul.500.co/).



First of all, we want to give a special thanks ❤️ to the open source community who supported us along the way. We couldn’t have done it without you!

This funding will enable the core team to solely focus on Refine providing new features, frequent updates and support for the community.  We’ll also able to grow our team and accelerate our product roadmap.

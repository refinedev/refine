With 2022, a new future in our careers as software developers. We will meet new technologies this year and continue to pursue innovations as before.

<!--truncate-->

### Production Oriented Approach 🧰 

`{ Production }`

Developing is often a real challenge. It is necessary to follow the innovations and use all these in the right place at the right time and again in the right way. Sometimes all these prevent us from producing or slow down our production process. It is our responsibility to ensure that technology serves us in a development environment where we prioritize production.

### Is speed everything?

So is speed exactly everything?

3 main components affect production in traditional production methods.

Speed 💨
Quality👌 
Time ⌛

Can you imagine what a development environment would be like where we provided all 3 components at the same time?

### Briefly Refine

#### What gives us Refine?

The word headless is underlined above. So Refine drop you into UI heaven, meanwhile, you can also use Antd library support.

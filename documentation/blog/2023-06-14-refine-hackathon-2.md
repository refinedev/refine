We're back with another exciting event for the open-source community - the 2nd refine Open Source Hackathon! 

As with the first one, this hackathon is about showcasing your skills, creativity, and innovation using refine.


**[refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)** is a React-based framework for the rapid ✨ development of CRUD web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by CRUD operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts like authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n. refine shines on data-intensive applications like admin panels, dashboards, internal tools and storefronts. 


⏰ The hackathon will kick off on June 21, and we're proud to host it on collaboration with the [DEV](https://dev.to/refine) platform. All the other hackathon details and submission process will be announced on the official launch day on [DEV](https://dev.to/).


🚀 The prizel pool is **$10,000** in total and a special gifts along with **limited edition** swag kits!

## Together with Open Source Community



refine draws its strength from the open-source community, and we are grateful to have the support of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) which has significant contributions to the community. We’re proud to host our second hackathon on collaboration with the [DEV](https://dev.to/refine) platform. 

It's worth noting that refine has built-in [data provider support](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/data-providers/supabase) for Supabase and [UI framework integration](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/mui/) for Material UI. So we believe they will be excellent backend and UI solution for your hackathon project.

Supabase and MUI will also be providing swag kits for the winners.

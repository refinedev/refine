### Refine Native

Refine Native, the empowering library for Refine, opens up a world of possibilities for creating cross-platform apps. You can build web and native crud apps 3x faster by leveraging the power of React Native and refine.

Inside this project, you'll discover two awesome libraries: [@refinenative/expo-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refinenative/expo-router) and [@refinenative/react-native-paper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refinenative/react-native-paper). The first one seamlessly integrates Refine with your expo-router project, while the second one provides handy components built with react-native-paper, speeding up the creation of CRUD pages.

## Introducing Claude 4: A New Bar for Coding AI Models

For those who may not know, [Claude 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) was released a few days ago. Developed by Anthropic, the Opus and Sonnet variants currently rank as the world’s best coding models. They achieved an astonishing 72.5% and 72.7% on the SWE-bench benchmark, significantly outperforming their Claude 3 predecessors.

According to Anthropic’s official announcement, frontier coding agents have seen remarkable success with the Claude 4 series. Cursor describes it as state-of-the-art for coding and a major leap in understanding complex codebases. Replit highlights significant improvements in precision and multi-file refactoring. Block reports that Claude 4 is the first model to enhance code quality during editing and debugging in its agent, Goose, without compromising reliability.

As the Refine team, we were eager to put it to the test—both to see how it could elevate the quality of Refine AI’s outputs and to determine whether we could replicate the success reported by leading teams.

## Claude 4: The Secret Sauce Behind Improved Internal Software

From our very first internal tests, we observed that Claude 4 truly elevates Refine AI’s already strong capabilities to new heights. The most immediate difference? Your UIs and dashboards look noticeably better—right out of the box.

With Claude 4's expanded reasoning and much better design context, Refine AI now cooks up more polished layouts, delivers more stable styling by default. What that translates into is you'll be wasting a lot less time messing around with it.

But nice pictures are only half the story. In the background, Claude 4 also gives us about a 30% boost in token effectiveness. So what does that mean for you? Refine AI will spending less Refine Credits, and the whole process will be less expensive and smoother.

And here's the bonus: Claude 4 won't just take your new projects to the next level; it'll also help with your existing ones, making them even better.

The end result is a faster, leaner experience that produces top-notch code with fewer headaches, all while receiving just what you had in mind.

## Ready to See the Difference?

Claude 4 is not so much reinventing Refine AI as much as it is elevating it. This combination makes our assistant smarter and more streamlined, which ultimately means better results in less time. Whether you're cobbled together a fast internal project or just prototyping something more advanced, you'll feel the simpler process and appreciate the enhanced visual quality and streamlined look immediately.

We're actually super excited where this is headed. We're just adding the finishing touches on the full integration. If you haven't used Refine AI in a bit, now is actually the time to give it a shot! We've got even more features coming soon, like the highly anticipated shadcn UI integration!

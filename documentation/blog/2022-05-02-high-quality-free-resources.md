## Before the last item

In fact, I've included most of the resources we'll need when building a website. There may be my shortcomings, things I forgot, or there may be better ones, you can specify them in the comments, I would be very happy, I can write a follow-up article with them 😇

But apart from all these, there is one last item that I want to talk to you about. You wrote a title saying it will make our life easier, but you may say how adding all these to a project will make our life easier. At this point, we come across "refine" 💪

### 10. refine <a name="refine"></a> 

**[refine](https://refine.dev/)** is a React-based framework for rapid building of internal tools. It's is a a collection of helper hooks, components and providers. They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.

**refine** offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to admin panels, B2B applications and dashboards.

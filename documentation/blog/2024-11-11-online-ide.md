**This article was last updated on November 11, 2024 to include best practices for collaboration and security in cloud-based development environments.**

## Introduction

Programmers and software engineers spend a significant proportion of their time using IDEs and text editors for writing code. Most IDEs and text editors, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad++, are desktop applications. However, there are also several online editors that you can use for building, testing, prototyping, and showcasing simple hobby projects, especially in web development.

This article will introduce you to some of the most popular free online Editors and IDEs, such as CodeSandbox, Codepen, JSFiddle, StackBlitz, Glitch, and Repl.it. You can use some of these online IDEs and text editors to build simple front-end applications, while others, like Glitch, are for both front-end and full-stack applications.

Your choice of an online IDE largely depends on whether you want to build a front-end, back-end, or full-stack application. We will explore the pros and cons of these IDEs and text editors.

It is worth pointing out that this article will explore the main features of the most popular online editors and IDEs. It will not identify which editor is the best. We will also go above and beyond to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each editor so that you can choose one which meets your needs.

## What Is an Online Code Editor

In simple terms, an online code editor is a web-based tool for developers to write, edit, and test code in their browsers. These online code editors come packed with features for languages and all the other features of the conventional text editors.

The unique feature of online code editors, different from the traditional stationary IDEs, is the fact that no setup or configuration is required on the system, thus making it easily available and user-friendly. Just for this reason, online code editors can be invaluable in the case of needing people to work collaboratively on the fly over the particular piece in which you are interested.

In other words, you are able to quickly build prototypes or entire projects in a really powerful and flexible coding setup.

## Why We Need Online Code Editors ?

Online Code Editors have been growing important due to a number of reasons:

1. **Accessibility**: Any device with an internet connection can write and test code through an online code editor. That means there's no need for a specific setup or powerful hardware in order to make coding accessible.

2. **Collaboration**: Most of these online code editors allow the feature of real-time collaboration, meaning a lot of developers can work on a project at the same time. This helps a lot for team projects, pair programming, and in most educational setups.

3. Convenience: No software installations and configurations are required on your machine. Online code editors come pre-installed and pre-configured, so they save you time and save you from managing many development environments.

4. **Cost-effective**: Most of the code editors available online come for free, or they have a free tier attached to them, which makes them a cheaper solution for all individual developers and organizations, especially those working on a tight budget.

5. **Version Control and Backup**: Most of the online editors are well integrated with the likes of Git, which makes it very easy and smooth when it comes to version tracking and collaboration. Besides, the code is usually automatically saved to reduce the danger of losing information.

6. **Learn and Experiment**: Online code editors are the easiest means to get coding for novices without all the hassles needed for setting up a local development environment. They are also perfect for experimenting with new languages or frameworks.

In other words, online code editors are flexible, collaborative, and accessible, hence improving one's productivity, and developers of all levels find it convenient to write code.

## Bootstrapping a project for demonstration

It is possible to import a project from your local machine or Git hosting service like GitHub to some online text editors or IDEs. Therefore, we will create a basic **[Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)** application in this section. We will use this application for illustration.

[Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) is a React-based framework for developing web applications. It is useful when developing data-intensive CRUD applications such as admin panels and dashboards. Follow the steps below to bootstrap a simple Refine application using [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate).

### How to create Refine application

The easiest way to start using Refine is to bootstrap an application using Refine CLI.

```sh
npm create refine-app@latest
```

You must respond to the command line prompts. You can also choose the default options throughout if you wish.

After successfully creating the Refine project, navigate to the `example-project` project directory using the command below.

```sh
cd example-project
```

To be sure the project you created is working, use the command below to launch the development server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The above command will launch the development server on localhost. You can host the project on GitHub to import it to some of the online editors we will explore in the sections below.

## Top free online Editors and IDEs with free plans for hobby projects

You will explore the most popular online editors and IDE's with generous free plans in this section.

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is another online editor for building front-end and full-stack web apps. It is handy for quickly prototyping, showcasing, and experimenting with new ideas and projects. You can also embed a sandbox in blog posts, documentation, and GitHub project READMEs.

Like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox has several starter templates to choose from when launching a new sandbox. It supports the most popular front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Gatsby, and Next.

To start using CodeSandbox, you can sign in using your GitHub, Google, or Apple account. You can create a new sandbox using one of the built-in starter templates or create a sandbox by importing a project from your local machine or a GitHub repository.

#### How to upload a project from local computer to CodeSandbox?

CodeSandbox has a command line tool for uploading a project from your local machine to CodeSandbox. Follow the steps below to use it for deploying the example project you created above.

#### Install the `codesandbox` command line tool

To upload a sandbox using a project in your local machine, install the `codesandbox` command line tool by running the command below on the terminal.

```sh
npm install --global codesandbox
```

The command above will install the `codesandbox` command line tool globally. To check if the installation was successful, run the command below on the terminal. It should display the version of the `codesandbox` command line tool.

```sh
codesandbox -V
```

#### Log into your CodeSandbox account from the command line

After successfully installing the command line tool described in the previous step, log into your CodeSandbox account using the `codesandbox` command line tool. Run the command below on the terminal.

```sh
codesandbox login

## When Not to Use Online IDEs – Key Limitations to Keep in Mind

Here’s a breakdown of situations where online IDEs might not be the best choice based on project type, along with some key limitations. While platforms like CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, and Gitpod are fantastic for accessibility and collaboration, they do come with some drawbacks that can impact our workflow.

### Key Limitations of Online IDEs

1. Performance Constraints

- Limited Resources: Most online IDEs cap CPU and memory usage, which can slow down large applications or complex builds.
- Network Dependence: Heavy reliance on the internet is a drawback; any lag or downtime can disrupt workflow, whereas local IDEs offer more reliable performance.

2. Limited Language and Framework Support

- Popular languages like JavaScript and Python are well-supported, but some specialized languages or frameworks may lack full support.
- This can limit projects that require specific runtime configurations unavailable on the platform.

3. Restricted Access to System Resources

- Online IDEs often don’t allow access to certain local resources or custom libraries, which becomes an issue if a project needs hardware interaction or system-level tools.

4. Security and Privacy Concerns

- Working with sensitive or proprietary data comes with cloud storage risks, even with security protocols.
- Local environments offer more control over data security, which is essential depending on project needs.

5. Limited Customization Options

- Advanced configurations and custom plugins may not be available in online IDEs, limiting how we optimize the environment for high-stakes or complex projects.
- Local IDEs, on the other hand, allow for better customization to suit our workflow.

### When to Consider Using a Local IDE Instead

- High-Performance Projects: For data-intensive work or those requiring high processing power (e.g., ML models), local development is usually the better choice.
- Large, Multilingual Projects: Projects with specific frameworks, languages, or complex build setups are better suited for local IDEs, which handle custom configurations more flexibly.
- Sensitive Data Projects: For projects involving customer or proprietary data, sticking to local environments is a safer choice.
- Offline Access: If we might need to work offline, a local setup is the way to go.
- Full-Featured Debugging: While online IDEs offer basic debugging, local options like VS Code or IntelliJ are more robust for complex debugging scenarios.

## Security and Privacy Considerations to Use Online IDEs

I just wanted to bring up some key security and privacy considerations when using online IDEs. While these platforms are incredibly convenient and support collaboration, there may be some potential security and privacy risks in projects dealing with sensitive data or proprietary code.

### 1. Data Privacy Risks

- Cloud Storage: Most online IDEs store code and files in the cloud, which can expose our data to security breaches or unauthorized access.
- Third-Party Access: Some platforms use servers managed by third parties, raising risks if those providers don’t adhere to top security standards. Local environments give us more control over data security.

### 2. Limited Control Over Data Location

- Data Residency: For projects with data residency requirements (like GDPR), online IDEs rarely allow selecting storage locations, so sensitive data might be stored in regions with less stringent privacy laws.

### 3. Authentication Vulnerabilities

- Account Security: Many online IDEs rely on single sign-on (SSO) through GitHub, Google, etc. If these accounts are compromised, it opens up risks of unauthorized access.
- Two-Factor Authentication: Always enable 2FA on accounts tied to online IDEs to add extra security.

### 4. Risks to Public Exposure

- Shared Workspaces: Collaborative features in online IDEs can, if not set correctly, unintentionally expose code or data. Always double-check permissions on shared projects to avoid accidental public access.

### 5. Network Dependency for Security

- Unsecured Networks: Using online IDEs over public networks, like Wi-Fi, increases interception or attack risks. When working remotely, ensure you use a VPN and secure connections to protect data in transit.

When Not to Use Online IDEs for Security Reasons

- Highly Sensitive Data: Projects involving sensitive customer data or proprietary information are best kept in local environments, where we control access and storage.
- Regulatory Compliance Requirements: For projects with strict data residency or security standards, local IDEs help ensure compliance without third-party storage risks.
- Internal-Only Projects: For internal tools or codebases that shouldn’t be accessible outside the organization, local setups are a safer choice.

## Conclusion

If you are a programmer, software engineer, or developer, online editors and IDEs come in handy for prototyping, experimenting, sharing, and collaborating on small projects. As explained above, there are several online editors.

These editors include StackBlitz, Codepen, CodeSandbox, JSFiddle, Glitch, and Repl.it IDE. Each online editor has its strengths and weaknesses. Codepen and JSFiddle are suitable for small front-end projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On the other hand, you can use either CodeSandbox or StackBlitz for large front-end projects and Glitch or Repl.it for back-end or full-stack applications. Among the online editors described above, CodeSandbox is the most flexible when creating projects.

Hopefully, this article equipped you with first-hand information to choose the online editor that meets your needs.

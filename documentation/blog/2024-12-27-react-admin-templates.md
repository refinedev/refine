**This article was last updated on December 27, 2024, to include practical strategies for choosing React admin templates, such as avoiding overly complex templates, ensuring scalability, and verifying licenses. Simplified explanations and real-world examples have been added for improved clarity and usability.**

## Introduction

Templates are blueprints or models or guides used to make something. We can have a house template, that is used as a sample to build a house. Also in the world of software development, we have website design templates that present ideas on how to create a specific website for specific industries.

Admin templates are prebuilt templates that offer a rich set of features that can be used to quickly build an admin app. The admin app can be a dashboard for your products and services, an app interface, or an admin area.

As React continues to gain popularity in web development, it is becoming increasingly important to have a robust and user-friendly react admin interface. Here are the top five React admin templates that are currently available on the market

## Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Admin Templates

1. Picking looks over features.
2. Choosing a template that doesn't match your tech stack.
3. Choosing too complicated templates.
4. Neglecting scalability.
5. Skipping documentation review.
6. Forgetting to test responsiveness.
7. Overlooking performance.
8. Using templates that have unclear licenses.
9. Blind reliance on free templates without scrutiny. 10. Ignoring accessibility requirements.

## Common Mistakes While Choosing an Admin Template (And How I Avoid Them)

During all these years, I have tried lots of admin templates. Sometimes, they worked just fine, but other times I ran into big problems because I didn't think things through.

Let me share with you some of the mistakes I've made and seen others make, and how you can avoid them.

### Picking Looks Over Features

**What I Did Wrong:**  
I used to select templates based on how good they look. Later on, I felt some of them lacked charts or good form handling that I needed.

**What I Do Now:**  
First, I make sure that the template will have all the tools that I need for my project. Although the design is important, features like authentication, dashboards, and responsive layouts concern me more.

### Not Matching It to My Tech Stack

**What I Did Wrong:**

It once happened that I accidentally chose a Vue template for a React project. Suffice it to say that didn't go well, and I had to build much of it from scratch.

**What I Do Now:**

I will only use templates that are made specifically for the framework I am working in. For instance, if I were working in React, then I would find templates using either Material UI or Tailwind CSS.

### Choosing Over-Complicated Templates

**What I Did Wrong:**  
I made a very bad choice with a template, which had too many features for what I needed, such as multi-language support and drag-and-drop tools, that made everything harder to customize.

**What I Do Now:**  
Me, I keep it simple: I don't need all advanced features; if so, I use a basic template. Easier to work with, faster to set up.

### Forgetting About Scalability

**What I Did Wrong:**

I once chose a template, which was fine for small projects, but became a nightmare when my app grew. It didn't handle large amounts of data well.

**What I Do Now:**

I check whether the template is well-structured. Are the components reusable? Can I scale it up if the project grows? Templates with clear folder structures are way easier to maintain.

### Ignoring Documentation

**What I Did Wrong:**

Once, I selected a free template with zero documentation. I had to spend hours trying to figure out how things worked.

**What I Do Now:**

I always check the documentation first. A well-documented template saves a lot of time. If it is a paid template, I make sure it comes with support.

### Not Testing on Different Devices

**What I Did Wrong:**

I once completed an administrative panel and realized it looked terrible on a mobile device. It just wasn't responsive at all.

**What I Do Now:**

Before I start building, I am testing the demo on both mobile and desktop; a good template should look great everywhere.

### Forgetting About Performance

**What I Did Wrong:**

I used a template with so many animations and libraries not really needed. It made my app really slow.

**What I Do Now:**

I run a quick performance test using Lighthouse on the demo. Looking for templates featuring lazy loading with minimal dependencies.

### Not Verifying the License

**What I Did Wrong:**

Once, I did not know that the license for using the template in one of my client projects prohibited commercial use. I had to redo everything.

**What I Do Now:**

I always check out the license, whether I use a template or not. In case there's a commercial project in line, then I really see to it that this covers under its license.

### Free Templates Not Vetted

**What I Did Wrong:**  
I used a free template without reviewing the code. It was badly written and full of bugs.

**What I Do Now:**  
If it's free, I check out the GitHub repo for how often it is updated and how many issues it has. Sometimes, it's worth paying for a high-quality template.

### Ignoring Accessibility

**What I Did Wrong:**

Early on, I never thought about accessibility. Then, I realized that some users couldn't navigate my admin panel properly.

**What I Do Now:**

I look for templates with keyboard navigation, screen reader, and high-contrast mode support. Accessibility is more important than you think.

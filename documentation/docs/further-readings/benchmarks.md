title: Benchmarks

Many **Refine** projects involve migrating an existing vanilla React application to the **Refine** framework. By collecting data from various migration projects, we were able to do some benchmarking by comparing codebases.

**Refine** makes your codebase significantly smaller, by eliminating redundant code such as _reducers_, _actions_, and _unit tests_. We've measured a significant reduction in project size in terms of _"lines of code"_ and _"number of files"_:

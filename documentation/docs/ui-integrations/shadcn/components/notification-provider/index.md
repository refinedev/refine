# Notification Provider

Admin dashboards need to show feedback when users perform actions - whether it's successfully saving data, handling errors, or allowing users to undo operations. The notification provider gives you a complete toast notification system that integrates seamlessly with Refine's data operations.

Built on [Sonner](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sonner), it automatically handles notifications for CRUD operations and supports undoable actions where users can reverse operations like deletions.

## Installation

Add the notification system to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.refine.dev/r/notification-provider.json
```

This installs the notification provider with the `sonner` toast library.

## Setup

Configure the notification provider in your app root:

```tsx
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { useNotificationProvider } from "@/components/refine-ui/notification/use-notification-provider";
import { Toaster } from "@/components/refine-ui/notification/toaster";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Refine
        notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
        // ... other props
      >
        {/* Your app content */}
      </Refine>
      <Toaster />
    </>
  );
}
```

That's it! Refine will now automatically show notifications when users create, update, or delete data. You'll see success messages when operations complete and error messages when something goes wrong.

## Manual Notifications

You can also trigger notifications manually in your components:

```tsx
import { useNotification } from "@refinedev/core";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { open } = useNotification();

  const handleCustomAction = () => {
    // Show success notification
    open?.({
      type: "success",
      message: "Profile updated",
      description: "Your profile changes have been saved successfully",
    });
  };

  const handleError = () => {
    // Show error notification
    open?.({
      type: "error",
      message: "Upload failed",
      description: "The file could not be uploaded. Please try again.",
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCustomAction}>Update Profile</button>
      <button onClick={handleError}>Simulate Error</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Undoable Actions

For destructive actions like deletions, you can show notifications that allow users to undo the operation:

```tsx
const handleDelete = (id: string) => {
  open?.({
    type: "progress",
    message: "Post deleted",
    description: "The post has been moved to trash",
    undoableTimeout: 5, // Show undo button for 5 seconds
    cancelMutation: () => {
      // This runs if user clicks undo
      console.log("Restoring post...");
    },
  });
};
```

This is particularly useful for delete operations where you want to give users a chance to recover their data.

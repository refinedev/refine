You can make basic validations with Ant Design [Form.Item](https://ant.design/components/form/#Form.Item) rules propertyp to the forms you have created with Refine. In addition, it allows you to make custom validations that you want or need. It is very easy to add your custom rules and validations by using the validator function within the Form.Item rules property. In the example below, a custom form validation process is explained in detail.

The `useStepsForm` hook is a method that allows you to split your form into multiple sections using an Ant Design [Steps](https://ant.design/components/steps/) component, which can be used to manage your form. If your form contains multiple steps, as in the example below, it's pretty simple to manage and handle your Steps form using the **refine** `useStepsForm` hook.

[Refer to the **refine** useStepsForm hook documentation for more information. →](/docs/ui-frameworks/antd/hooks/form/useStepsForm/)

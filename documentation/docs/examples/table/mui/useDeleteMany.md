The `useDeleteMany` is one of Refine's data hooks. It removes more than one data from the database. We used the `useDeleteMany` hook to remove more than one record from our table in this scenario. On your table, you may remove multiple records by selecting them and pressing delete. You can get more information by examining the example.

**refine** allows you to use all the features of [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) with `@refinedev/react-table` adapter. In this way, you can manage your server-side data operations. By using this adapter, you can directly use all the features of React Table in your **refine** project.

[Refer to the **refine** React Table documentation for more information. →](/docs/packages/documentation/react-table/)

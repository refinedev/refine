`useLink` is a hook that leverages the `Link` property of the [`routerProvider`][routerprovider] to create links compatible with the user's router library.

:::info
It's recommended to use the `Link` component from your router library instead of this hook. This hook is used mostly for internal purposes but also exposed for customization needs.

`Link` components or the equivalents from the router libraries has better type support and lets you use the full power of the router library.

## What is refine?

**refine** is a React-based framework for the rapid ✨ development of web applications.
It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by **CRUD** operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts like **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

**refine** is _headless by design_ offering unlimited styling and customization options.

## What do you mean by "headless" ?

Instead of being a limited set of pre-styled components, **refine** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. They are all decoupled from your _UI components_ and _business logic_, so they never keep you from customizing your _UI_ or coding your own flow.

**refine** seamlessly works with any **custom design** or **UI framework you favor**. For convenience, it ships with ready-made integrations for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Use cases

**refine** shines on _data-intensive_ applications like _admin panels_, _dashboards_ and _internal tools_. Thanks to built-in **SSR support**, **refine** can also power _customer-facing_ applications like _storefronts_.

description: useLogout data hook from refine is a modified version of react-query's useMutation for unauthentication.
---

`useLogout` calls the `logout` method from the [`authProvider`](/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider.md) under the hood.  
It unauthenticates the app if the `logout` method from the `authProvider` resolves and if it rejects, it keeps authentication state the same.

It returns the result of `react-query`'s [`useMutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/reference/useMutation).
Data that is resolved from the `logout` will be returned as the `data` in the query result.

## Usage

By default, Refine already provides a logout button on the sider and if you want to use this default button you won't need to handle the logout flow manually.
If you want to build a custom logout button instead of the default one, `useLogout` can be used like this:

```tsx title="components/customLogoutButton"
import { useLogout } from "@pankod/refine-core";

export const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { mutate: logout } = useLogout();

  return <button onClick={() => logout()}>Logout</button>;
};
```

## Redirection after logout

We have 3 options to manage the redirection after logout process.

- If promise returned from `logout` is resolved with nothing, app will be redirected to the `/login` route by default.

- A custom url can be resolved from the promise returned from the `logout` method of the [authProvider](/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider.md).

```tsx
const authProvider: AuthProvider = {
    ...
    logout: () => {
        ...
        return Promise.resolve("/custom-url");
    }
}
```

A custom url can be given to mutate function from the `useLogout` hook if you want to redirect yourself to a certain url.

```tsx
import { useLogout } from "@pankod/refine-core";

const { mutate: logout } = useLogout<{ redirectPath: string }>();

logout({ redirectPath: "/custom-url" });
```

Then, you can handle this url in your `logout` method of the `authProvider`.

```tsx

const authProvider: AuthProvider = {
    ...
    logout: ({ redirectPath }) => {
        ...
        return Promise.resolve(redirectPath);
    }
}

```

- If promise returned from the `logout` method of the [authProvider](/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider.md) gets resolved with `false` no redirection will occur.

```tsx
const authProvider: AuthProvider = {
    ...
    logout: () => {
        ...
        return Promise.resolve(false);
    }
}
```

:::caution
Custom url given to mutate function from `useLogout` overrides the one on the `authProvider`.
:::

:::tip
`mutate` acquired from the `useLogout` can accept any kind of object for values since the `logout` method from the `authProvider` doesn't have a restriction on its parameters.
:::

:::caution
This hook can only be used if the `authProvider` is provided.

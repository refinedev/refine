## About this Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use **refine** by building a fully-functioning CRUD app, from scratch to full launch! üöÄ

We'll cover the following topics:

- Setting up your development environment
- Create your first refine app
- Understanding the [`dataProvider`](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/)
- What is the [`resources`](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#resources) concept
- Adding CRUD pages
<!-- -   Understanding the `authProvider` -->

:::note
If you would rather start exploring **refine** with some examples before diving in, visit our [examples](/docs/3.xx.xx/examples/) page and choose an example to open and explore it in an online editor.

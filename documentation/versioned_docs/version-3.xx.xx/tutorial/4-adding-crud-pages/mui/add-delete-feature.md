There are many ways to delete a record. In this tutorial, we will first use the `<DeleteButton/>` to delete a record and then we will learn how to enable the delete feature on the show page and edit page.

## Adding Delete Feature to List Page

Let's start by adding the delete feature to the list page. To do this, we will use the `<DeleteButton/>` component.

`<DeleteButton/>` is a **refine** component that is used to delete a record. When you click on the delete button, it will show a confirmation modal. If you confirm the deletion, it will delete the record.

[Refer to the `<DeleteButton/>` documentation for more information &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/mui/components/buttons/delete-button/)

To add a delete feature to the blog posts table, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open the `src/pages/blog-posts/list.tsx` file on your editor.

2. Import the `<DeleteButton/>` component from `@pankod/refine-mui`:

   ```tsx
   import { DeleteButton } from "@pankod/refine-mui";
   ```

3. Add the `<DeleteButton/>` component to the `actions` column of the table as shown below:

   ```tsx
   {
       field: "actions",
       headerName: "Actions",
       renderCell: function render({ row }) {
           return (
               <>
                   <EditButton hideText recordItemId={row.id} />
                   <ShowButton hideText recordItemId={row.id} />
                   // highlight-next-line
                   <DeleteButton hideText recordItemId={row.id} />
               </>
           );
       },
       align: "center",
       headerAlign: "center",
       minWidth: 80,
   },
   ```

   `recordItemId` is the id of the record you want to delete.

Now, you can try to delete a record from the list page. Just click on the delete button of the record you want to delete and confirm the deletion.

## Enabling Delete Feature on Show Page and Edit Page

When we define a resource, we can enable the delete feature on the show page and edit page by setting the `canDelete` property to `true` as shown below:

```tsx src="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import {
  Layout,
  ReadyPage,
  ErrorComponent,
  LightTheme,
  CssBaseline,
  GlobalStyles,
  ThemeProvider,
  RefineSnackbarProvider,
  useNotificationProvider,
} from "@pankod/refine-mui";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";

import { BlogPostList } from "pages/blog-posts/list";
import { BlogPostEdit } from "pages/blog-posts/edit";
import { BlogPostShow } from "pages/blog-posts/show";
import { BlogPostCreate } from "pages/blog-posts/create";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={LightTheme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      <GlobalStyles styles={{ html: { WebkitFontSmoothing: "auto" } }} />
      <RefineSnackbarProvider>
        <Refine
          routerProvider={routerProvider}
          dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
          notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
          Layout={Layout}
          ReadyPage={ReadyPage}
          catchAll={<ErrorComponent />}
          resources={[
            {
              name: "blog_posts",
              list: BlogPostList,
              edit: BlogPostEdit,
              show: BlogPostShow,
              create: BlogPostCreate,
              //highlight-next-line
              canDelete: true,
            },
          ]}
        />
      </RefineSnackbarProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
export default App;
```

After setting the `canDelete` property to `true`, you will see a delete button on the show page and edit page. Because we used the `<Show/>` and `<Edit/>` components in the show page and edit page, the delete button will be added automatically in these components.

[Refer to the `<Refine/>` documentation for more information about the `canDelete` property &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#candelete)

You can also use `useDelete` hook provided by **refine** to delete a record.

[Refer to the `useDelete` documentation for more information information &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/hooks/data/useDelete/)

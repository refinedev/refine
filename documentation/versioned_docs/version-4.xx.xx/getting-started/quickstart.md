**Refine** works on any environment that can run **React** (incl. _Vite, Next.js, Remix, and CRA(Legacy)_ etc.)

Although you could take the time to manually set up your environment and install the **Refine** packages afterwards, the optimal way to get started with **Refine** is using the [Browser-based Scaffolder](https://refine.dev/?playground=true) and **CLI-based Scaffolder**.

## Using CLI

Use `create-refine-app` to quickly bootstrap a new **Refine** project with lots of options to fit your needs.

```sh
npm create refine-app@latest
```

## Using Browser

Refine's browser-based scaffolder has the same set of options as the CLI-based scaffolder. It is a great way to set up a new project and have a preview of how it looks before you download it.

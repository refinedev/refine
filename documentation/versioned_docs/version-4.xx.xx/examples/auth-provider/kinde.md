[Kinde](https://kinde.com/) is a service that makes authentication and authorization easy by providing a range of methods to choose from. In this example, you'll see how to use Kinde Login with Refine.

Kinde example doesn't work in CodeSandbox embed mode as it needs to whitelist callback URLs. With [this](https://xnv6hq-5173.csb.app/) link, you can open the example in the browser and try it.

You may use the `useTable` hook to process your data with features compatible with the Ant Design [Table](https://ant.design/components/table/) Component. You can be used as an out-of-the-box feature without needing to do extra operations for sorting, filtering, and pagination.

[Refer to the Refine useTable hook documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-table)

SHADCN DOCUMENTATION REWRITE PLAN
==========================================

MAJOR REWRITES NEEDED (LLM-style to Human-readable):
-----------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/data-table/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Heavy LLM-style with "Features:" bullet list, "When to use:" section
   - ACTION: Rewrite to match Ant Design pattern - conversational intro, direct usage examples

✅ 2. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/notification-provider/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Technical instruction-style, lacks context and real-world examples
   - ACTION: Add conversational context, explain why notifications matter in Refine apps

✅ 3. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/themed-layout/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Bullet point feature list, technical setup focus
   - ACTION: Rewrite with human context about theming in admin interfaces

✅ 4. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/sign-up-form/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: LLM-style feature listing and technical focus
   - ACTION: Focus on real signup scenarios in admin dashboards

✅ 5. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/forgot-password/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Feature-focused rather than user-focused
   - ACTION: Context about password recovery in admin systems

✅ 6. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/hooks/use-form/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Technical hook documentation without real-world context
   - ACTION: Explain form handling in CRUD operations with examples

✅ 7. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/error-component/index.md - COMPLETED
   - ISSUE: Feature list approach rather than problem-solving approach
   - ACTION: Focus on error handling patterns in admin applications

FILES TO REMOVE (Obsolete/Duplicate):
------------------------------------

1. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/forms/index.md
   - REASON: Replaced by individual form components and use-form hook

2. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/views.md/index.md
   - REASON: Split into individual basic-views components

3. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/buttons/raw.md (if exists)
   - REASON: Should be individual button components

MINOR CLEANUP NEEDED:
--------------------

1. /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/auto-save-indicator/index.md
   - ISSUE: Minor LLM-style formatting in some sections
   - ACTION: Remove "Key Features:" style formatting, keep conversational content

REFERENCE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
-----------------------------

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (Human-readable):
- /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/buttons/create-button/index.md
- /docs/ui-integrations/shadcn/components/basic-views/list/index.md
- Ant Design component documentation style

❌ AVOID (LLM-style):
- "Features:" bullet lists
- "When to use:" sections
- Technical instruction tone
- Feature enumeration without context

WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES:
------------------------
- Start with conversational explanation of WHY the component exists
- Use real Refine admin dashboard scenarios
- Show code examples early
- Explain integration with Refine patterns
- Keep API reference sections but make them scannable
- Use "you" and "your application" language
- Focus on developer experience and practical usage

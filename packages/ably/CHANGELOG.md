## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

    **Moving to the `@refinedev` scope 🎉🎉**

    Moved to the `@refinedev` scope and updated our packages to use the new scope. From now on, all packages will be published under the `@refinedev` scope with their new names.

    Now, we're also removing the `refine` prefix from all packages. So, the `@pankod/refine-core` package is now `@refinedev/core`, `@pankod/refine-antd` is now `@refinedev/antd`, and so on.

## 3.29.0

### Minor Changes

-   Update type declaration generation with `tsc` instead of `tsup` for better navigation throughout projects source code.

## 3.28.0

### Minor Changes

-   [#2440](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/2440) [`0150dcd070`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/0150dcd0700253f1c4908e7e5f2e178bb122e9af) Thanks [@aliemir](https://github.com/aliemir)! - Update type declaration generation with `tsc` instead of `tsup` for better navigation throughout projects source code.

## 3.27.0

### Minor Changes

-   All of the refine packages have dependencies on the `@pankod/refine-core` package. So far we have managed these dependencies with `peerDependencies` + `dependencies` but this causes issues like #2183. (having more than one @pankod/refine-core version in node_modules and creating different instances)

    Managing as `peerDependencies` + `devDependencies` seems like the best way for now to avoid such issues.

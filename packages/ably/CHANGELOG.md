## 4.1.6

### Patch Changes

- [#5765](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5765) [`0c197d82393`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/0c197d823939ae1fd4e0ee4b5a422322853b1e45) Thanks [@aliemir](https://github.com/aliemir)! - refactor: package bundles and package.json configuration for exports

  Previously, Refine packages had exported ESM and CJS bundles with same `.js` extension and same types for both with `.d.ts` extensions. This was causing issues with bundlers and compilers to pick up the wrong files for the wrong environment. Now we're outputting ESM bundles with `.mjs` extension and CJS bundles with `.cjs` extension. Also types are now exported with both `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` extensions.

  In older versions ESM and CJS outputs of some packages were using wrong imports/requires to dependencies causing errors in some environments. This will be fixed since now we're also enforcing the module type with extensions.

  Above mentioned changes also supported with changes in `package.json` files of the packages to support the new extensions and types. All Refine packages now include `exports` fields in their configuration to make sure the correct bundle is picked up by the bundlers and compilers.

  **Moving to the `@refinedev` scope 🎉🎉**

  Moved to the `@refinedev` scope and updated our packages to use the new scope. From now on, all packages will be published under the `@refinedev` scope with their new names.

  Now, we're also removing the `refine` prefix from all packages. So, the `@pankod/refine-core` package is now `@refinedev/core`, `@pankod/refine-antd` is now `@refinedev/antd`, and so on.

## 3.29.0

### Minor Changes

- Update type declaration generation with `tsc` instead of `tsup` for better navigation throughout projects source code.

## 3.28.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2440](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/2440) [`0150dcd070`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/0150dcd0700253f1c4908e7e5f2e178bb122e9af) Thanks [@aliemir](https://github.com/aliemir)! - Update type declaration generation with `tsc` instead of `tsup` for better navigation throughout projects source code.

## 3.27.0

### Minor Changes

- All of the refine packages have dependencies on the `@pankod/refine-core` package. So far we have managed these dependencies with `peerDependencies` + `dependencies` but this causes issues like #2183. (having more than one @pankod/refine-core version in node_modules and creating different instances)

  Managing as `peerDependencies` + `devDependencies` seems like the best way for now to avoid such issues.

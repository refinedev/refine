### Patch Changes

- [#5765](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5765) [`0c197d82393`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/0c197d823939ae1fd4e0ee4b5a422322853b1e45) Thanks [@aliemir](https://github.com/aliemir)! - refactor: package bundles and package.json configuration for exports

  Previously, Refine packages had exported ESM and CJS bundles with same `.js` extension and same types for both with `.d.ts` extensions. This was causing issues with bundlers and compilers to pick up the wrong files for the wrong environment. Now we're outputting ESM bundles with `.mjs` extension and CJS bundles with `.cjs` extension. Also types are now exported with both `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` extensions.

  In older versions ESM and CJS outputs of some packages were using wrong imports/requires to dependencies causing errors in some environments. This will be fixed since now we're also enforcing the module type with extensions.

  Above mentioned changes also supported with changes in `package.json` files of the packages to support the new extensions and types. All Refine packages now include `exports` fields in their configuration to make sure the correct bundle is picked up by the bundlers and compilers.

### Minor Changes

- [#5478](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5478) [`24d81ca854`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/24d81ca8546997627145f5b1c35951a58db1dbc5) Thanks [@alicanerdurmaz](https://github.com/alicanerdurmaz)! - feat: add `gqlQuery` and `gqlMutation` support. #5489

  Previously, `@refinedev/hasura` package only supported GraphQL operations through `meta.fields`.

  Now we've added `gqlQuery` and `gqlMutation` fields in `meta` object.

  You can utilize these fields along with `graphql-tag` package to build your queries/mutations.

  See the updated documentation for more information: https://refine.dev/docs/data/packages/hasura/

  Query Example:

  ```tsx
  import { useList } from "@refinedev/core";
  import gql from "graphql-tag";

  const PRODUCTS_QUERY = gql`
    query ProductsList(
      $offset: Int!
      $limit: Int!
      $order_by: [products_order_by!]
      where: $where
    ) {
      products(offset: $paging, limit: $filter, order_by: $order_by, where: $where) {
        id
        name
      }
      categories_aggregate(where: $where) {
        aggregate {
          count
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  const { data } = useList({
    resource: "products",
    meta: { gqlQuery: PRODUCTS_QUERY },
  });
  ```

  Mutation Example:

  ```tsx
  import { useForm } from "@refinedev/core";
  import gql from "graphql-tag";

  const CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION = gql`
    mutation CreateProduct($object: posts_insert_input!) {
      createOneProduct(object: $object) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `;

  const { formProps } = useForm({
    resource: "products",
    meta: { gqlMutation: CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION },
  });
  ```

  - `metaData` prop is now deprecated for all data provider methods. Use `meta` prop instead.

    > For backward compatibility, we still support `metaData` prop with refine v4.

    create: async ({
    -    metaData
    +    meta
    }) => {
        ...
    },
    ```

  - `sort`, `hasPagination`, and `metaData` parameters of `getList` method are now deprecated. Use `sorters`, `pagination`, and `meta` parameters instead.

    > For backward compatibility, we still support `sort`, `hasPagination` and `metaData` props with refine v4.

  **Moving to the `@refinedev` scope ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰**

  Moved to the `@refinedev` scope and updated our packages to use the new scope. From now on, all packages will be published under the `@refinedev` scope with their new names.

  Now, we're also removing the `refine` prefix from all packages. So, the `@pankod/refine-core` package is now `@refinedev/core`, `@pankod/refine-antd` is now `@refinedev/antd`, and so on.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- All of the refine packages have dependencies on the `@pankod/refine-core` package. So far we have managed these dependencies with `peerDependencies` + `dependencies` but this causes issues like #2183. (having more than one @pankod/refine-core version in node_modules and creating different instances)

  Managing as `peerDependencies` + `devDependencies` seems like the best way for now to avoid such issues.

## 3.25.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated pagination parameters default values and added `hasPagination` property to `getList` method of the data providers.

  **Implementation**

  Updated the `getList` method accordingly to the changes in the `useTable` and `useList` of `@pankod/refine-core`. `hasPagination` is used to disable pagination (defaults to `true`)

  **Use Cases**

  For some resources, there might be no support for pagination or users might want to see all of the data without any pagination, prior to these changes this was not supported in **refine** data providers.

We're releasing refine devtools in beta. refine devtools is designed to help you debug and develop your refine apps. It will be a collection of features including monitoring queries and mutations, testing out inferencer generated codes, adding and updating refine packages from the UI and more. ðŸ¤¯

## Usage

Install latest version of `@refinedev/cli`:

```bash
npm install @refinedev/cli@latest
```

Install `@refinedev/devtools` with `@refinedev/cli`

```bash
npm run refine devtools init
```

> ðŸš¨ If you don't have `@refinedev/cli` installed already, you can follow the [installation guide](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/cli/#how-to-add-to-an-existing-project) to add it to your project.

![devtools-install](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/23058882/7d7341cc-1edd-4cf3-b330-1796c6a8afc5)

Ta-da! ðŸŽ‰ Everything is ready now, you can use the refine devtools in your project! ðŸ•¶

> Devtools only works in development mode and have no overhead on production builds. You don't need to do anything special to exclude DevTools from your bundle.

## Project Setup

We will take off from where we left off in the previous post. In order to get everything up and running, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the `react-memoization` project from [this repo](https://github.com/anewman15/react-memoization) to a folder of your choice.
2. Navigate to the cloned folder and open it in your code editor.
3. Run `yarn install` to install all npm packages.
4. Run `yarn start` to start the server.
5. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Use `Ctrl + Shift + J` on Ubuntu or `Command + Option + J` on Mac to inspect the webpage and open browser's console.
